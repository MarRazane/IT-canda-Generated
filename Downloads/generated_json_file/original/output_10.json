                    "description": "Limiting what options a user can select from a drop-down list based on a value they already selected in a prior drop-down list is a common, yet simple task to configure in NetSuite. For this example we\u2019ll use a fictitious company running NetSuite and who sells vintage wines. \u00a0Here they want to assign all of the items they sell to a Wine Country for better visibility and reporting inventory and sales data. \u00a0They also want to assign their items to a Wine Region however, the list should only show Wine Regions that specifically belong to the previously chosen Wine Country. Step 1 First we must create a new custom List called \u201cWine Country.\u201d Step 2 Next we create a new custom Record Type called \u201cWine Region\u201d and leave the Include Name Field checked. \u00a0Once the new Record Type has been saved, add an additional field called \u201cWine Country\u201d to the custom record, give the field, in this scenario, a Type of Multi-Select, and select \u201cWine Country\u201d from the List/Record drop-down list. Step 3 Now create the new entries in the \u201cWine Region\u201d custom record to link all the appropriate Wine Region\u2019s to their respective Wine Country value. This can be accomplished by going to Customizations > Lists, Records, & Fields > Record Types, and click \u201cNew Record\u201d next to the \u201cWine Region\u201d record. Step 4 Next create a new Item field so that users can select a Wine Country on the item record. \u00a0Assign the new field to the List/Record value of \u201cWine Country.\u201d Step 5 Now we must create a new Item field so that users can select a Wine Region on the item record. \u00a0Assign the new field to the List/Record value of \u201cWine Region.\u201d Step 6 On the Sourcing and Filtering tab of the \u201cWine Region\u201d field, configure it to filter values as shown below. \u00a0This step is important to note, and is responsible for the actually filtering of values on the Wine Region field based on what has been previously selected from the Wine Country field. Step 7 Now, when creating a new item, or modifying an existing item, we can specify the Wine Country and Wine Region values. \u00a0For this example, we chose \u201cAustralia\u201d as the Wine Country, now we only see the Wine Region\u2019s that belong to Australia as specified by our custom record. If we can be of any assistance in the creation of dependent drop down lists as shown above, or with any other area of your NetSuite environment, our NetSuite consulting team can help.\u00a0 We have\u00a015 years of NetSuite experience, and more than 25 years of experience implementing ERP solutions.\u00a0 Please contact\u00a0us at\u00a0info@67.solutions\u00a0or by phone at\u00a0647-631-2528."

                    "description": "If you have used or administered NetSuite for any period of time, you may be familiar with the Mass Update feature. This powerful feature allows users to perform updates and changes to data in mass, using the many per-built updates readily available and with minimal configuration. However, sometimes there are specific scenarios where there may not be a pre-built mass update available for a specific task. \u00a0In today\u2019s example, we will cover how to perform a mass update by creating our own custom mass update. In this example, we are going to assume that a number of unapproved journal entries have been imported into the system in error. \u00a0Because of the large number of journal entries imported, our task is to clean up and remove the transaction in question as quickly as possible. Step 1 In step 1 we create a simple SuiteScript 2.0 that will process the returned transaction records that we pass to it. \u00a0In our SuiteScript below, we are looking specifically for the type of transaction \u201ccontext.type\u201d, and the transaction id \u201ccontext.id.\u201d \u00a0Once we have this information, we can then process the record, in this case, delete the record. Step 2a Once we\u2019ve uploaded the SuiteScript to the documents folder in NetSuite, we can then locate it and proceed to create our Script Record. Step 2b Be sure to select \u201cMass Update\u201d as the script type and then provide a name our new Mass Update script. Step 3 Let\u2019s create our deployment record for our newly-created Mass Update script. \u00a0It is imperative to select \u201cJournal Entry\u201d from the Applies To field List of values. \u00a0Also note that this same script created in Step 2a and Step 2b above, may be used multiple times on different record, simply by creating another unique deployment record and selecting a different record from the Applies To list of values. Step 4 Now that the deployment record has been created and assigned to the Journal Entry transaction type, lets navigate over to the Mass Updates, and view our custom update. \u00a0This is found under Custom Updates > Journal Entry and our newly-created mass update is Mass Delete. \u00a0Go ahead and click on the link. Step 5 Create the Mass Update search by providing a meaningful name. \u00a0Under criteria, let\u2019s select \u201cType\u201d and set it to \u201cis Journal\u201d and let\u2019s also select \u201cStatus\u201d and set it to \u201cis Journal:Pending Approval.\u201d \u00a0We want to be sure NOT to return any Journal Entry records with the Status Approved! \u00a0When ready, click on the \u201cPreview\u201d button. \u00a0You should also \u201cSave\u201d you search at this time as well. Step 6 Our final set is to review the returned records. \u00a0If they are the desired results, we can check off each that apply (or apply all) and continue by clicking the \u201cPreform Update\u201d button. \u00a0At this point in time, each individual record is passed to the script we create in Step 1 above to be processed, in our case, deleted.

                    "description": "67 Solutions integrates charter-specific capabilities into NetSuite\u2019s cloud ERP solution to help its customers save time, money, and manhours in this corner of the broader airline industry. A business model centered on \u201crenting\u201d aircraft to users that prefer private over commercial air transport, airline charter has historically catered to a select group of travelers that range from corporate users to government officials to wealthy families. The COVID-19 pandemic impacted charter airline companies early and significantly, yet the industry subsequently benefited from a boost in private air travel as fliers looked to avoid large, crowded commercial planes and spaces.\u00a0 In addition to renting or leasing aircraft, airline charter companies also manage equipment maintenance, provide repairs and parts, operate flight schools and manage other owners\u2019 planes. These multifaceted operations require careful orchestration and modern business systems that reduce manual processes, streamline operations, and improve efficiencies.\u00a0 Presently, many airline charter companies still rely on systems like QuickBooks for accounting plus a myriad industry-specific applications to run their divisions and operations. Without a cloud-based, unified business management system for handling intercompany transactions, managing revenue recognition and helping close the monthly books quickly, these entities waste significant time and money on manual processes, spreadsheet manipulation, and data re-entry.\u00a0 In this paper, we look at the key technology challenges that today\u2019s airline charter companies are dealing with and show how cloud ERP with integrations into airline charter-specific solutions can help organizations overcome these issues.\u00a0 A Thriving Industry Charter services are hired by individuals, corporations, celebrities, government officials, and more. Charter aircraft can also be modified to perform other roles, including emergency medical services, cargo delivery or equipment resupply.\u00a0 Air charter flights operate on the passenger\u2019s schedule, which allows considerably more flexibility than a commercial airline\u2019s schedule. Charters are able to fly in and out of more than 5,000 public use airports in the U.S.\u2014more than 100 times that of the airlines\u2014and they provide convenient access to destinations for passengers who can afford the additional cost.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0The global air charter services market is valued at approximately $26.6 billion (USD) and expected to post a 4% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between now and 2027. Companies operating in the space offer a variety of rental and ownership options that include (but aren\u2019t limited to):\u00a0\u00a0 Fractional Ownership:\u00a0 This model functions like a time share, with airplanes instead of real estate.\u00a0 Individuals or businesses can claim a part of the airplane and its crew when needed. There are additional complexities with charter companies having different but overlapping ownership with other entities like flight schools. Jet Card Programs: Providers sell blocks of retail flight hours, similar to a prepaid phone card.\u00a0 On-Demand Charter: Providers don\u2019t own or operate aircraft; they function as a broker in the jet charter process. Fixed Fleet Operators: These are FAA-certified local private jet charter owners that provide \u201cair taxi\u201d services to their clients.\u00a0 In addition to air transportation services, charter companies typically provide all of the support services that come with using, owning, and/or maintaining aircraft. \u2026 Continue reading \"Making the Airline Charter Industry Stronger, Faster, and Smarter with Cloud ERP\""
